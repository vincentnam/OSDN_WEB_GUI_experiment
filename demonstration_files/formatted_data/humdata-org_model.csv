Please make sure you have read our Mapping Populations overview page before choosing and downloading a dataset.      A description of the modelling methods used for age and sex structures can be found in   Tatem et al and  Pezzulo et al. Details of the input population count datasets used can be found here, and age/sex structure proportion datasets here.   Both top-down 'unconstrained' and 'constrained' versions of the datasets are available, and the differences between the two methods are outlined  here. The  datasets represent the outputs from a project focused on construction of consistent 100m resolution population count datasets for all countries of the World structured by male/female and 5-year age classes (plus a &lt;1 year class). These efforts necessarily involved some shortcuts for consistency. The unconstrained datasets are available for each year from 2000 to 2020. The constrained datasets are only available for 2020 at present, given the time periods represented by the building footprint and built settlement datasets used in the mapping.
