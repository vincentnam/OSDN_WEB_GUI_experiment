Abstract,18,"['Background: In order to improve the biological control agent (BCA) efficacy, stress factors threatening the viability of microorganisms during spray application need to be determined. The effect of spray mixture temperature and exposure time on Trichoderma harzianum T 22 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens QST713 viability were tested. Concurrently the combined effect of mechanical and thermal stress effect on BCA viability were tested at two initial spray mixture temperatures (14 and 25 °C) by simulating a spray application using airblast sprayers featured by different tank capacity and a spray liquid circuit (without and with hydraulic agitation system). To assess the BCA microorganism viability, spray mixture samples were collected at time intervals along trials and plated to count the colony forming units (CFU). Results: The critical temperature threshold that inhibited BCA viability was 35 °C with 30 min of exposure. The sprayer type, the initial temperature of the spray mixture and the temperature increment during the trials significantly decreased the number of CFU recovered. When simulating a spray application, the spray mixture temperature increase rate was determined mainly by the residual amount of spray mixture in the tank. Even if the tank capacity does not substantially affect the final temperature reached by the spray mixture, the higher residual spray mixture in bigger tanks can expose the BCAs for a longer time to critical temperatures.Conclusions: Experimental trials allowed us to identify the effect of factors affecting the viability of tested BCAs, providing information about the actual chance to guarantee the biological efficacy of BCA treatments. © 2023 The Authors. Pest Management Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.', 'Background: The production of fruit and vegetables rich in health-promoting components in an eco-friendly context represents the winning answer to the world population demand for food. In this study, the effects of different treatments on the yield and fruit chemical characteristics of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) are reported. The treatments included three inducers of plant defence responses (chitosan, Trichoderma harzianum T-22 and Bacillus subtilis QST713) applied alone or before Cucumber mosaic virus infection. Fruit production and antioxidant compounds were investigated by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: Compared to control fruit harvested from untreated and healthy plants, treatment with QST713 increased the fruit number. Furthermore, plant treatments with T22, QST713 and chitosan alone enhanced fruit carotenoids (lutein and β-carotene), ascorbic acid and phenolic acids (caffeoyl glucoside and p-coumaroyl glucoside). In parallel, compared to fruit harvested from only CMV-infected plants, treatments with T22, QST713 and chitosan before CMV enhanced fruit ascorbic acid and flavonoids (quercetin 3-O-xylosyl-rutinoside and rutin). Conclusion: Antioxidant compounds of tomato fruit can increase with the application of the plant defence inducers, thus protecting both the consumer and plant health. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.', 'Biological crop protection is recommended to be applied alternately or together with chemical one, to protect human health from the excessive use of toxic pesticides. Presence of microorganisms can influence the concentration of chemical pollutants in soil. The aim of this study is to estimate the influence of a commercial biological fungicide containing Trichoderma harzianum Rifai T-22 on dissipation kinetics and degradation of five herbicides belonging to different chemical classes: clomazone, fluazifop-P-butyl, metribuzin, pendimethalin, and propyzamide, in two types of soil. Results of the study revealed that T. harzianum T-22 influences pesticide degradation and dissipation kinetics of the non-persistent herbicides: clomazone, fluazifop-P-butyl, and metribuzin. In soil with a higher content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter, degradation increased by up to 24.2%, 24.8%, and 23.5% for clomazone, fluazifop-P-butyl, and metribuzin, respectively. In soil with lower organic content, degradation was on a low level, of 16.1%, 17.7%, and 16.3% for clomazone, fluazifop-P-butyl, and metribuzin, respectively. In our study, the addition of the biological preparation shortened herbicide dissipation half-lives, from 0.3 days (2.9%) for fluazifop-P-butyl, to 18.4 days (25.1%) for clomazone. During the degradation study, no significant differences were noticed for pendimethalin, belonging to persistent substances. Biological protection of crops can modify pesticide concentrations and dissipation rates. On one hand, this may result in the reduced effectiveness of herbicide treatments, while on the other, it can become a tool for achieving cleaner environment.', 'Diseases affecting stand establishment are a major obstacle to organic production of peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Stand losses of 50% or more are possible with untreated seed. Biological, botanical, and organic seed treatments or soil amendments were tested for efficacy against pre- and postemergence damping-off of peanut in greenhouse, microplot, and field plot trials. Seed of the lines Perry, GP-NC 343, and Bailey (tested as N03081T) were used in all trials. Commercial formulations of Bacillus subtilis (Kodiak), B. pumilus (Yield Shield), Trichoderma harzianum (T-22 PB and Plantshield HC), Muscodor albus, and Coniothyrium minitans (Contans); activated charcoal; two separate soil amendments of dried herbage of Monarda didyma cultivars; a commercial fungicide control (Vitavax PC); and an untreated control were tested in natural soil in the greenhouse. Vitavax PC and Kodiak were the only treatments that resulted in higher percent emergence and survival than in untreated seed. A separate greenhouse experiment was conducted in natural soil or natural soil infested with field isolates of Aspergillus niger. Seed were treated with Kodiak, copper hydroxide (Champion), Plantshield HC, Kodiak + Plantshield HC, Streptomyces griseoviridis (Mycostop), hot water, Vitavax PC, or were left untreated. Seedling emergence and survival was much lower in infested versus uninfested soil. Seed treatment with Kodiak increased percent emergence and survival compared to untreated seed, but was not as effective as Vitavax PC. Field microplot studies in 2007 and 2008 at Clayton, NC, evaluated four seed treatments on the peanut lines following small grain cover crops, soil amendment with M. albus, or no cover. Cover crops did not affect emergence or interact with seed treatments. In field studies in 2007 and 2008 at Lewiston, NC, the peanut lines were planted with M. albus infurrow, with Kodiak or T. harzianum seed treatments, or were untreated. In the 2007 trial, none of the treatments improved stands compared to the untreated check. In 2008, the highest stand counts were produced by seed treated with Kodiak. In both years, Bailey produced the greatest stand counts. A. niger was strongly associated with postemergence damping-off in the field. Regardless of peanut line, in many trials, Kodiak seed treatment increased emergence and survival over untreated seed.', 'Early root traits and allometrics of wheat are important for competition and use of resources. They are under-utilized in research and un-explored in many ancient wheats. This is especially true for the rhizosheath emerging from root-soil interactions. We investigated root morphology, root/shoot relations and the amount of rhizosheath of four tetrapoid wheat seedlings (30 days after emergence): the italian landrace Saragolle Lucana and modern varieties Creso, Simeto and Ciclope, and tested the hypothesis that inoculation with Trichoderma harzianum T-22 (T-22) enhances rhizosheath formation and affects wheat varieties differently. Overall growth of non-inoculated plants showed different patterns in wheat varieties, with Saragolle and Ciclope at the two extremes: Saragolle invests in shoot rather than root mass, and in the occupation of space with highest (p < 0.05) shoot height to the uppermost internode (5.02 cm) and length-to-mass shoot (97.8 cm g-1) and root (more than 140 m g-1) ratios. This may be interpreted as maximizing competition for light but also as a compensation for low shoot efficiency due to the lowest (p < 0.05) recorded values of optically-measured chlorophyll content index (22.8). Ciclope invests in biomass with highest shoot (0.06 g) and root (0.04 g) mass and a thicker root system (average diameter 0.34 mm vs. 0.29 in Saragolle) as well as a highest root/shoot ratio (0.95 g g-1 vs. 0.54 in Saragolle). Rhizosheath mass ranged between 22.14 times that of shoot mass in Ciclope and 43.40 in Saragolle (different for p < 0.05). Inoculation with Trichoderma increased the amount of rhizosheath from 9.4% in Ciclope to 36.1% in Simeto and modified root architecture in this variety more than in others. Ours are the first data on roots and seedling shoot traits of Saragolle Lucana and of Trichoderma inoculation effects on rhizosheath. This opens to new unreported interpretations of effects of Trichoderma inoculation on improving plant growth.', 'Fungi have the potential to produce a large repertoire of bioactive molecules, many of which can affect the growth and development of plants. Genomic survey of sequenced biofertilizer fungi showed many secondary metabolite gene clusters are anchored by iterative polyketide synthases (IPKSs), which are multidomain enzymes noted for generating diverse small molecules. Focusing on the biofertilizer Trichoderma harzianum t-22, we identified and characterized a cryptic IPKS-containing cluster that synthesizes tricholignan A, a redox-active ortho-hydroquinone. Tricholignan A is shown to reduce Fe(III) and may play a role in promoting plant growth under iron-deficient conditions. The construction of tricholignan by a pair of collaborating IPKSs was investigated using heterologous reconstitution and biochemical studies. A regioselective methylation step is shown to be a key step in formation of the ortho-hydroquinone. The responsible methyltransferase (MT) is fused with an N-terminal pseudo-acyl carrier protein (ψACP), in which the apo state of the ACP is essential for methylation of the growing polyketide chain. The ψACP is proposed to bind to the IPKS and enable the trans MT to access the growing polyketide. Our studies show that a genome-driven approach to discovering bioactive natural products from biofertilizer fungi can lead to unique compounds and biosynthetic knowledge.', 'Growth chamber, greenhouse, and field experiments were conducted with fungicides and biological control agents, including nonpathogenic isolates of Fusarium oxysporum, to test their ability to control disease caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. asparagi and F. proliferatum. In greenhouse studies with asparagus seedlings in soil, Trichoderma harzianum strain T-22, benomyl, and fludioxonil treatments increased root weight and decreased root disease compared with the infested control when a low level of F. oxysporum f. sp. asparagi and F. proliferatum was used. The fungicide fludioxonil limited plant death caused by Fusarium spp. at high inoculum levels, whereas T. harzianum strain T-22 was not effective. Nonpathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum were effective in limiting Fusarium disease on asparagus seedlings in culture tubes, although isolates differed in their ability to control disease caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. asparagi and F. proliferatum. In greenhouse studies, no significant differences in plant death were found between asparagus plants growing in media infested with F. oxysporum f. sp. asparagi and F. proliferatum and left untreated, and those treated with nonpathogenic F. oxysporum. The efficacy of fungicides and biological control products to control Fusarium crown and root rot under commercial field conditions could not be evaluated due to low disease pressure.', 'In summer 2006, a root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum was observed in commercial farms on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) on the cv Billò and Borlotto. A study was undertaken in order to evaluate the efficacy of different biological control agents applied as seed dressing. In the presence of a medium-high disease incidence, among the biocontrol agents tested, Trichoderma harzianum T 22, Bacillus subtilis QST 713, followed by Pseudomonas chlororaphis, provided generally the best control. Their efficacy was also consistent in the different trials. Also the mixture of T. harzianum + T. viride provide a good disease control. Streptomyces griseoviridis and the 3 strains of Fusarim oxysporum, although less effective, provided a partial control of the disease. The fungicide mancozeb provided only a partial disease control.', 'Media and culturing protocols were identified that supported the formation of submerged conidia and microsclerotia (MS) by Trichoderma harzianum Rifai strain T-22 using liquid culture fermentation. Liquid media with a higher carbon concentration (36 g L(-1)) promoted MS formation at all C:N ratios tested. Hyphae aggregated to form MS after 2 d growth and after 7 d MS were fully melanized. This is the first report of MS formation by T. harzianum or any species of Trichoderma. Furthermore, submerged conidia formation was induced by liquid culture media, but yields, desiccation tolerance, and storage stability varied with C:N ratio and carbon rate. Air-dried MS granules (<4% moisture) retained excellent shelf life under cool and unrefrigerated storage conditions with no loss in conidial production. A low-cost complex nitrogen source based on cottonseed flour effectively supported high MS yields. Amending potting mix with dried MS formulations reduced or eliminated damping-off of melon seedlings caused by Rhizoctonia solani. Together, the results provide insights into the liquid culture production, stabilization process, and bioefficacy of the hitherto unreported MS of T. harzianum as a potential biofungicide for use in integrated management programs against soilborne diseases.', 'One of the most important environmental factors impacting crop plant productivity is soil salinity. Fungal endophytes have been characterised as biocontrol agents that help in plant productivity and induce resistance responses to several abiotic stresses, including salinity. In the salt-tolerant cereal crop barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), there is limited information about the metabolites and lipids that change in response to inoculation with fungal endophytes in saline conditions. In this study, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and LC-electrospray ionisation (ESI)-quadrupole-quadrupole time of flight (QqTOF)-MS were used to determine the metabolite and lipid changes in two fungal inoculated barley genotypes with differing tolerance levels to saline conditions. The more salt-tolerant cultivar was Vlamingh and less salt tolerant was Gairdner. Trichoderma harzianum strain T-22 was used to treat these plants grown in soil under control and saline (200 mM NaCl) conditions. For both genotypes, fungus-colonised plants exposed to NaCl had greater root and shoot biomass, and better chlorophyll content than non-colonised plants, with colonised-Vlamingh performing better than uninoculated control plants. The metabolome dataset using GC-MS consisted of a total of 93 metabolites of which 74 were identified in roots of both barley genotypes as organic acids, sugars, sugar acids, sugar alcohols, amino acids, amines, and a small number of fatty acids. LC-QqTOF-MS analysis resulted in the detection of 186 lipid molecular species, classified into three major lipid classes-glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, and sphingolipids, from roots of both genotypes. In Cultivar Vlamingh both metabolites and lipids increased with fungus and salt treatment while in Gairdner they decreased. The results from this study suggest that the metabolic pathways by which the fungus imparts salt tolerance is different for the different genotypes.', 'Soil microbial communities interact with roots, affecting plant growth and nutrient acquisition. In the present study, we aimed to decipher the effects of the inoculants Trichoderma harzianum T-22, Pseudomonas sp. DSMZ 13134, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 or Pseudomonas sp. RU47 on the rhizosphere microbial community and their beneficial effects on tomato plants grown in moderately low phosphorous soil under greenhouse conditions. We analyzed the plant mass, inoculant colony forming units and rhizosphere communities on 15, 22, 29 and 43 days after sowing. Selective plating showed that the bacterial inoculants had a good rhizocompetence and accelerated shoot and root growth and nutrient accumulation. 16S rRNA gene fingerprints indicated changes in the rhizosphere bacterial community composition. Amplicon sequencing revealed that rhizosphere bacterial communities from plants treated with bacterial inoculants were more similar to each other and distinct from those of the control and the Trichoderma inoculated plants at harvest time, and numerous dynamic taxa were identified. In conclusion, likely both, inoculants and the rhizosphere microbiome shifts, stimulated early plant growth mainly by improved spatial acquisition of available nutrients via root growth promotion. At harvest, all tomato plants were P-deficient, suggesting a limited contribution of inoculants and the microbiome shifts to the solubilization of sparingly soluble soil P.', 'Soil salinity has a serious impact on plant growth and agricultural yield. Inoculation of crop plants with fungal endophytes is a cost-effective way to improve salt tolerance. We used metabolomics to study how Trichoderma harzianum T-22 alleviates NaCl-induced stress in two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars, Gairdner and Vlamingh, with contrasting salinity tolerance. GC-MS was used to analyse polar metabolites and LC-MS to analyse lipids in roots during the early stages of interaction with Trichoderma. Inoculation reversed the severe effects of salt on root length in sensitive cv. Gairdner and, to a lesser extent, improved root growth in more tolerance cv. Vlamingh. Biochemical changes showed a similar pattern in inoculated roots after salt treatment. Sugars increased in both cultivars, with ribulose, ribose, and rhamnose specifically increased by inoculation. Salt stress caused large changes in lipids in roots but inoculation with fungus greatly reduced the extent of these changes. Many of the metabolic changes in inoculated cv. Gairdner after salt treatment mirror the response of uninoculated cv. Vlamingh, but there are some metabolites that changed in both cultivars only after fungal inoculation. Further study is required to determine how these metabolic changes are induced by fungal inoculation.', 'The application of Trichoderma strains with biocontrol and plant growth-promoting capacities to plant substrates can help reduce the input of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture. Some Trichoderma isolates can directly affect plant pathogens, but they also are known to influence the phytohormonal network of their host plant, thus leading to an improvement of plant growth and stress tolerance. In this study, we tested whether alterations in the phytohormone signature induced by different Trichoderma isolates correspond with their ability for biocontrol and growth promotion. Four Trichoderma isolates were collected from agricultural soils and were identified as the species Trichoderma harzianum (two isolates), Trichoderma ghanense, and Trichoderma hamatum. Their antagonistic activity against the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis was tested in vitro, and their plant growth-promoting and biocontrol activity against Fusarium wilt on melon plants was examined in vivo, and compared to that of the commercial strain T. harzianum T-22. Several growth- and defense-related phytohormones were analyzed in the shoots of plants that were root-colonized by the different Trichoderma isolates. An increase in auxin and a decrease in cytokinins and abscisic acid content were induced by the isolates that promoted the plant growth. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the relationship between the plant phenotypic and hormonal variables. PCA pointed to a strong association of auxin induction with plant growth stimulation by Trichoderma. Furthermore, the disease-protectant ability of the Trichoderma strains against F. oxysporum infection seems to be more related to their induced alterations in the content of the hormones abscisic acid, ethylene, and the cytokinin trans-zeatin riboside than to the in vitro antagonism activity against F. oxysporum.', 'The effects of inundative releases of entomopathogenic Steinernema carpocapsae and S. feltiae infective juveniles and applications of the biological control fungus Trichoderma harzianum T-22 (RootShield) on Pratylenchus penetrans and strawberry black root rot caused by Rhizoctonia fragariae were determined in field microplots and small plots. Entomopathogenic nematodes were applied as a soil drench at rates of 7.4 or 14.8 billion per ha in May or August for 3 years. RootShield was applied as crown dips at planting or later as a soil drench. There were no differences in P. penetrans from plants drenched with water alone or with S. carpocapsae or S. feltiae nematodes, averaged over rates and timing. The nematode species applied and the rate or timing of application had no effect on lesion nematodes. Our results suggest that P. penetrans exposure to living or heat-killed S. feltiae and associated bacteria resulted in temporary lack of motility. A progressively increasing proportion of P. penetrans became active again and, after 8 days, had infected tomato roots in similar numbers to unexposed P. penetrans. In laboratory assays and field plots or microplots, S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae did not permanently affect P. penetrans in tomato or strawberry.', 'This study, consisting of three experiments, was designed to assess whether diatomaceous earth, when applied to the surface of growing media, reduces adult fungus gnat Bradysia sp. nr. coprophila (Diptera: Sciaridae) emergence or inhibits the females from laying eggs; and whether fungus gnat adults are attracted to the fungus Trichoderma harzianum T-22 (Rifai strain KRL-AG2) under laboratory conditions. In the first two experiments, diatomaceous earth was applied at two different thicknesses (3.1 and 6.3 mm) and conditions (dry and moist) to the surface of a growing medium (Universal SB 300 Mix) after the growing medium had been artificially inoculated with second or third instars of fungus gnats, or before female fungus gnat adults were released into each deli squat container. In the third experiment, preparations of the fungus T. harzianum at the highest recommended label rate (0.889 kg/m3) were amended into the growing medium and processed 24, 48, or 72 h before use in a series of three two-choice trials with a two-armed experimental arena. In the first two experiments, the dry or moist layers of diatomaceous earth, in general, did not affect fungus gnats in terms of preventing adult emergence or egg laying by the females. During the course of these experiments, we observed that the diatomaceous earth dry treatments expanded as a result of absorbing moisture from the growing medium, creating fissures that allowed the fungus gnat larvae to pupate and females to lay eggs. In the third experiment, fungus gnat adults were not attracted to the T. harzianum treatments in any of the trials.', 'Trichoderma harzianum is a widely used biocontrol agent in agriculture. Obtaining a full inventory of the small molecules that can be biosynthesized from the encoded biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) is therefore useful for understanding associated plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. Here we heterologously reconstituted a polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) encoding gene cluster from T. harzianum t-22 in Aspergillus nidulans A1145. Six new tetronate natural products trihazone A-F (1-6) were isolated and elucidated by HRESIMS and 1D and 2D NMR data. Three of the products contain an exocyclic olefin, which is derived from the oxidative decarboxylation of an α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase ThnC as shown by biochemical assays.', 'Understanding the induction of plant defenses against viruses using biocontrol agents is essential for developing new strategies against these pathogens, given the ineffectiveness of chemical treatments. The ability of Trichoderma harzianum, strain T-22 (T22) to control Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme plants and the changes in the physiology of tomato treated/infected with T22/CMV were examined. Plant growth-promoting effects, photosynthetic performance, reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes, and phytohormones were investigated. T22 improved tomato growth in terms of plant height and improved photosynthesis, total chlorophyll content and plant gas exchange. In contrast, CMV induced a negative effect on dry matter accumulation and inhibited the photosynthetic capacity. The analysis of plant hormones demonstrated that treating with T22 before or simultaneously to CMV infection, led to a systemic resistance by jasmonic acid/ethylene and salicylic acid signaling pathways. Conversely, systemic resistance was abscissic acid-dependent when T22 treatment was administered after the CMV infection. In conclusion, the data reported here indicate that the T22-based strategy may be the most effective measure against CMV.', 'We investigated the capability of the plant-growth-promoting and biocontrol fungus Trichoderma harzianum Rifai 1295-22 (T-22) to solubilize in vitro some insoluble or sparingly soluble minerals via three possible mechanisms: acidification of the medium, production of chelating metabolites, and redox activity. T-22 was able to solubilize MnO2, metallic zinc, and rock phosphate (mostly calcium phosphate) in a liquid sucrose-yeast extract medium, as determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. Acidification was not the major mechanism of solubilization since the pH of cultures never fell below 5.0 and in cultures containing MnO2 the pH rose from 6.8 to 7.4. Organic acids were not detected by high-performance thin-layer chromatography in the culture filtrates. Fe2O3, MnO2, Zn, and rock phosphate were also solubilized by cell-free culture filtrates. The chelating activity of T-22 culture filtrates was determined by a method based on measurement of the equilibrium concentration of the chrome azurol S complex in the presence of other chelating substances. A size exclusion chromatographic separation of the components of the culture filtrates indicated the presence of a complexed form of Fe but no chelation of Mn. In liquid culture, T. harzianum T-22 also produced diffusible metabolites capable of reducing Fe(III) and Cu(II), as determined by the formation of Fe(II)-Na2-bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid and Cu(I)-Na2-2, 9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthrolinedisulfonic acid complexes. This is the first report of the ability of a Trichoderma strain to solubilize insoluble or sparingly soluble minerals. This activity may explain, at least partially, the ability of T-22 to increase plant growth. Solubilization of metal oxides by Trichoderma involves both chelation and reduction. Both of these mechanisms also play a role in biocontrol of plant pathogens, and they may be part of a multiple-component action exerted by T-22 to achieve effective biocontrol under a variety of environmental conditions.']"
